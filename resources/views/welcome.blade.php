<div class="text-drwhite text-xl text-center">Welcome to the Dragons Roost Campaign</div>
<div class="mt-2">
    In an empire ruled by sorcerers, the everyday Humble keep their heads down and mind their work.
    The Trade don't fare much better, plying their craft to serve their "betters." Among these number, we find our adventurers.
</div>

        In our first session, the adventurers speak with Pike, an odd bard that keeps his ear to the ground for jobs requiring a peculiar set of skills.
        Getting a finder's fee from the party, he leads them to and introduces them to non other than Otto Merrick, the head of the Merrick familia.
    </div>
    <div class="mt-2">
        Otto has a problem, and her name is Frigga. Frigga needs to make her way to Drake's Hollow, a city on the river to the southeast.
        Unfortunately, the Merricks have enemies, and travel needs to either be with overwhelming force (which Otto is reluctant to spend on his daughter, Frigga),
        or as clandestine as possible.
    </div>
    <div class="mt-2">
        Choosing the clandestine route, our intrepid heroes strike off with Frigga towards Drake's Hollow. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite clandestine enough.
        Were they betrayed by someone in the Merrick organization? Were they spotted leaving the city? Or perhaps someone in the party has an ulterior motive?
        Regardless, the brigands were quickly dispatched and disposed of, but not before the party discovered a token of the Grigori in the brigand leader's pocket.

    <div class="mt-2">
        <em>In Blood, Power</em>, is written in harsh draconic on the back of the coin. The front of the coin bears the likeness of Gregor Grigori, the head
        of the Familia Grigori. It seems the rivals of the Merrick's have taken yet another stab at them.
    </div>
    <div class="mt-2">
        Stopped at a waystation on the road, the party stands watch over Frigga's room while she sleeps. Unfortunately, in the night, someone had snuck into her room
        and taken her coinpurse. Frigga isn't impressed with the security provided by her escort, but remains unfazed in the face of apparent danger.
    </div>
    <div class="mt-2">
        Arriving in Drake's hollow, the party is paid, and hosted for dinner. Suspecting Gunther, Frigga's kind uncle, the party investigates, and finds that Gunther
        did have a trick up his sleeves: an unknown hoodlum that tested the party's security by stealing Frigga's coinpurse. While not enthused by the lax security,
        he did have good things to say about how quickly the party defended Frigga from the brigands on the road.
